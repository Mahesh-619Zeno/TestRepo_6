# fahrenheit-converter

This project is about processing the user's input (temperature in Fahrenheit). The `convert()` function converts the entered value to Celsius. The problem that could occur is an incorrect value, for example, entering a string instead of a number. Of course, the conversion would not work in such a case. For this reason, an exception handling has been added.
